# Health Management System

This is a simple Python program for managing personal health data. It allows users to track their daily food intake and exercise routines. Users can add information about what they ate or the exercises they did on a particular day, and the program will store this data in text files.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up or sign in to access the system using their name.
- **Food Tracking**: Users can check their daily food intake and add details about what they ate.
- **Exercise Tracking**: Users can monitor their daily exercise routines and input details about the exercises they performed.

## How to Use

1. **Running the Program**: Execute the `Health_Management_System()` function in a Python environment to start the program.

2. **Sign Up or Sign In**: If you're a new user, you can sign up by providing your name. If you're an existing user, you can sign in with your name.

3. **Choose Action**: After signing in, you'll be prompted to choose whether you want to deal with food information or exercise information.

4. **Food Section**:
   - Check Daily Food Intake: View the foods you've previously added.
   - Add What You Ate Today: Input details about the food you consumed on the current day.

5. **Exercise Section**:
   - Check Daily Exercise Routine: View the exercises you've previously added.
   - Add What You Did Today: Input details about the exercises you performed on the current day.

6. **Logging Out**: Once you're done, you can exit the program. Your data will be saved for future reference.

## Files

- **userdata.txt**: Stores user data for authentication.
- **Foods.txt**: Stores food intake information.
- **Workouts.txt**: Stores exercise routine information.

## Error Handling

The program includes basic error handling to handle exceptions gracefully and provide informative error messages to the user.

## Note

- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to read and write files in the directory where the program is executed.
- This program is intended for personal use and may require additional features and robustness for production environments.
